title: "A Positive-Sum Future"
---

I’ve been thinking a lot about what the net benefit of the AI platform wave is. The real question is how to empower every company out there to get more out of this platform shift and build their own AI-native capabilities and enterprise value (vs inadvertently just transfer their unique value to the tech sector!).

Here are some reflections I shared recently on social:

    helping every organization build durable capability and value, not just
    optimizing the status quo.
